Code,
Documentation,
Problems faced,
Observation
Aim:- To make single led chaser
Documentation:-Code is written in audrino ide.
               Along with audrino uno we used breadboard.
               pins selected decide the design of code and the connections that are to be made.
               suggestions:-use the connection of pins in easy combination so that it is being easy for you to write the code.
Problems Faced: code written in wrong way.
                loose connection or wrond connections.
                sometimes the parts used in hardware may be deffected.
                sometimes hardware and software both are correct but the code cant be ported.
Observations: Code should be written carefully and firstly checked with the compilation process.
              try to write short codes if convineint.
              Connections should be made proper.( like ground wire in ground slot in audrino and connector wire between audrino and breadboard).
              parts must be checked.
              port must be checked.
