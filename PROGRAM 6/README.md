Experiment 4 - LED Controlled By a Smart Phone using bluetooth
Create a system in which LED is controlled by a Smart Phone APP with the help of an Arduino. 
In this we connect a bluetooth module to the Arduino which would recieve the on/off signal from the Smart Phone 
(using the in-built bluetooth of Smart Phone) and hence will turn the LED on or off.
